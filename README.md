# HudSight2 localization files

If you want to make a translation, then create file with locale name with UTF-8 encoding
and translate english lines (right parts, not their identifiers :) )
special symbols like \n, \r, %d, %s, etc are not translatable

locales names can be found here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc233982.aspx
or here http://www.science.co.il/Language/Locale-codes.php
for example, English language and United States country gives "en-US" locale name
