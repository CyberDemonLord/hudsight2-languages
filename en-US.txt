OVERLAY_MODE_SIMPLE_SHORT			Crosshair overlay is drawn using a transparent window that is on top of all other windows.
OVERLAY_MODE_SIMPLE_LONG			Simple Overlay works well with Windowed or Borderless Windowed games. Also useful for games that use DirectX 9 or DirectX 12 with enabled Fullscreen Optimizations (FSO).

OVERLAY_MODE_REAL_SHORT				This is an improved version of the Simple Overlay mode that can display the overlay in Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE).
OVERLAY_MODE_REAL_LONG				Real Overlay works with Windowed, Borderless Windowed and Fullscreen Exclusive games. It requires Admin privileges. Incompatible with Vulkan and OpenGL fullscreen games.
OVERLAY_MODE_REAL_ADMIN_REQUIRED		Start app as admin to enable Real Overlay mode.
OVERLAY_MODE_REAL_STATE				Checking admin privileges...

OVERLAY_MODE_XBOX_SHORT				This overlay mode is similar to Real Overlay and can work in Fullscreen Exclusive games.

OVERLAY_MODE_XBOX_INSTALL			Install our Game Bar extension

OVERLAY_MODE_HOOKS_LONG				This mode is compatible with any game graphics mode. It works as Steam overlay and can be used with DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12, Vulkan and OpenGL graphics. However, some anti-cheats don't like such overlays (DLL injections).
OVERLAY_MODE_HOOKS_LAUNCH			Just start the game, wait for a few seconds and you should see your crosshair. If you do not see the crosshair and are confident it should be visible, please send a message to support.\n\nThe crosshair is not visible in this mode on the desktop, but only in games!
